**The security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for [Google's Go Language](https://golang.org).**
Built simple, powerful and extensible. This library implements peer-reviewed [IETF RFC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749),
counterfeits weaknesses covered in peer-reviewed [IETF RFC6819](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819) and countermeasures various database
attack scenarios, keeping your application safe when that hacker penetrates or leaks your database. OpenID Connect is
implemented according to [OpenID Connect Core 1.0 incorporating errata set 1](openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) and
includes all flows: code, implicit, hybrid.

This library considered and implemented:
* [The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)
* [OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding Practices](https://openid.net/specs/oauth-v2-multiple-response-types-1_0.html)
* [OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819) (partially)
* [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) (partially)

OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are difficult protocols. If you want quick wins, we strongly encourage you to look at [Hydra](https://github.com/ory-am/hydra).
Hydra is a secure, high performance, cloud native OAuth2 and OpenID Connect service that integrates with every authentication method
imaginable and is built on top of Fosite.

## Motivation

Fosite was written because our OAuth2 and OpenID Connect service [**Hydra**](https://github.com/ory-am/hydra)
required a secure and extensible OAuth2 library. We had to realize that nothing matching our requirements
was out there, so we decided to build it ourselves.

## API Stability

The core public API is almost stable as most changes will only touch the inner workings.

We strongly encourage vendoring fosite using [glide](https://glide.sh) or comparable tools.

## Example

The example does not have nice visuals but it should give you an idea of what you can do with Fosite and a few lines
of code.

![Authorize Code Grant](docs/authorize-code-grant.gif)

You can run this minimalistic example by doing

```
go get github.com/Masterminds/glide
go get -d github.com/ory-am/fosite
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ory-am/fosite
glide install
go install github.com/ory-am/fosite/fosite-example
fosite-example
```

There should be a server listening on [localhost:3846](https://localhost:3846/). You can check out the example's
source code [here](fosite-example/main.go).

## A word on quality

We tried to set up as many tests as possible and test for as many cases covered in the RFCs as possible. But we are only
human. Please, feel free to add tests for the various cases defined in the OAuth2 RFCs 6749 and 6819 or any other cases that improve the tests.

**Everyone** writing an RFC conform test that breaks with the current implementation, will receive a place in the
[Hall of Fame](#hall-of-fame)!

## A word on security

Please be aware that Fosite only secures parts your server side security. You still need to secure your apps and clients, keep
your tokens safe, prevent CSRF attacks, ensure database security, use valid and strong TLS certificates and much more. If you need any help or advice feel free to contact our security staff through [our website](https://ory.am/)!

We have given the various specifications, especially [OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.5.3),
a very close look and included everything we thought was in the scope of this framework. Here is a complete list
of things we implemented in Fosite:

* [No Cleartext Storage of Credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.4.1.3)
* [Encryption of Credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.4.1.4)
* [Use Short Expiration Time](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.5.3)
* [Limit Number of Usages or One-Time Usage](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.5.4)
* [Bind Token to Client id](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.5.8)
* [Automatic Revocation of Derived Tokens If Abuse Is Detected](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.2.1.1)
* [Binding of Refresh Token to "client_id"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.2.2.2)
* [Refresh Token Rotation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.2.2.3)
* [Revocation of Refresh Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.2.2.4)
* [Validate Pre-Registered "redirect_uri"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.2.3.5)
* [Binding of Authorization "code" to "client_id"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.2.4.4)
* [Binding of Authorization "code" to "redirect_uri"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.2.4.6)
* [Opaque access tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.4)
* [Opaque refresh tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5)
* [Ensure Confidentiality of Requests](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.1)
* [Use of Asymmetric Cryptography](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5.1.4.1.5)
  Fosite ensures that redirect URIs use https **except localhost** but you need to implement
  TLS for the token and auth endpoints yourself.

Additionally, we added these safeguards:
* **Enforcing random states:** Without a random-looking state or OpenID Connect nonce the request will fail.
* **Advanced Token Validation:** Tokens are layouted as `<key>.<signature>` where `<signature>` is created using HMAC-SHA256
 using a global secret.
  This is what a token can look like:
  `/tgBeUhWlAT8tM8Bhmnx+Amf8rOYOUhrDi3pGzmjP7c=.BiV/Yhma+5moTP46anxMT6cWW8gz5R5vpC9RbpwSDdM=`

Sections below [Section 5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-5)
that are not covered in the list above should be reviewed by you. If you think that a specific section should be something
that is covered in Fosite, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/ory-am/fosite/issues). Please be
aware that OpenID Connect requires specific knowledge of the identity provider, which is why Fosite only implements core
requirements and most things must be implemented by you (for example prompt, max_age, ui_locales, id_token_hint, user authentication, session management, ...).

**It is strongly encouraged to use the handlers shipped with Fosite as they follow the specs and are well tested.**

## A word on extensibility

Fosite is extensible ... because OAuth2 is an extensible and flexible **framework**.
Fosite let's you register custom token and authorize endpoint handlers with the security that the requests
have been validated against the OAuth2 specs beforehand.
You can easily extend Fosite's capabilities. For example, if you want to provide OpenID Connect on top of your
OAuth2 stack, that's no problem. Or custom assertions, what ever you like and as long as it is secure. ;)

## Installation

[Go 1.5+](https://golang.org) must be installed on your system and it is required that you have set up your
GOPATH environment variable.

```
go get -d github.com/ory-am/fosite
```

We recommend to use [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) or [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) to
mitigate compatibility breaks that come with new api versions.

## Documentation

There is an API documentation available at [godoc.org/ory-am/fosite](https://godoc.org/github.com/ory-am/fosite).

### Scopes

Before we skip ahead, it is important to note how scopes are being used in fosite per default.
The general pattern can be abstracted as `<scope>.<sub-scope>.<sub-sub-scope>.<sub-sub-...>`. Every level ("subset")
contains all sublevels, too. For example:

* `blogposts` grants scopes `blogposts.create`, `blogposts.delete`, `blockposts.read`, `blohposts.own.read`.
* `blogposts.create` does not grant `blogposts.delete` nor `blogposts.read` nor `blogposts.own.read`.
* `blogposts.own.read` does not grant `blogposts.create`.
* `blogposts.own` grants `blogposts.own.read` but not `blogposts.create`.

You can replace the default scope strategy if you need a custom one by implementing `fosite.ScopeStrategy`.

### Quickstart

Instantiating fosite by hand can be painful. Therefore we created a few convenience helpers available through the [compose package](/compose).
It is strongly encouraged to use these well tested composers.

In this very basic example, we will instantiate fosite with all OpenID Connect and OAuth2 handlers enabled. Please refer
to the [example app](fosite-example/main.go) for more details.

This little code snippet sets up a full-blown OAuth2 and OpenID Connect example.

```go
import "github.com/ory-am/fosite"
import "github.com/ory-am/fosite/compose"
import "github.com/ory-am/fosite/fosite-example/store"

// This is the exemplary storage that contains:
// * an OAuth2 Client with id "my-client" and secret "foobar" capable of all oauth2 and open id connect grant and response types.
// * a User for the resource owner password credentials grant type with usename "peter" and password "secret".
//
// You will most likely replace this with your own logic once you set up a real world application.
var storage = store.NewExampleStore()

// This secret is being used to sign access and refresh tokens as well as authorize codes.
var secret = []byte{"my super secret password"}

// check the api docs of compose.Config for further configuration options
var config = compose.Config {
  	AccessTokenLifespan: time.Minute * 30,
  	// ...
}

var oauth2Provider = compose.ComposeAllEnabled(config *Config, storage, secret, privateKey)

// The session will be persisted by the store and made available when e.g. validating tokens or handling token endpoint requests.
// The default OAuth2 and OpenID Connect handlers require the session to implement a few methods. Apart from that, the 
// session struct can be anything you want it to be.
type session struct {
	UserID string
	Foobar int
	
	// this is used in the OAuth2 handlers. You can set per-session expiry times here, for example.
	*oauth2Strat.HMACSession
	
	// this is used by the OpenID connect handlers. You can set custom id token headers and claims.
	*oidcStrat.DefaultSession
}

// The authorize endpoint is usually at "https://mydomain.com/oauth2/auth".
func authorizeHandlerFunc(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	// This context will be passed to all methods. It doesn't fulfill a real purpose in the standard library but could be used
	// to abort database lookups or similar things.
	ctx := NewContext()

	// Let's create an AuthorizeRequest object!
	// It will analyze the request and extract important information like scopes, response type and others.
	ar, err := oauth2.NewAuthorizeRequest(ctx, req)
	if err != nil {
		oauth2.WriteAuthorizeError(rw, ar, err)
		return
	}
	
	// Normally, this would be the place where you would check if the user is logged in and gives his consent.
	// We're simplifying things and just checking if the request includes a valid username and password
	if req.Form.Get("username") != "peter" {
		rw.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")
		rw.Write([]byte(`<h1>Login page</h1>`))
		rw.Write([]byte(`
			<p>Howdy! This is the log in page. For this example, it is enough to supply the username.</p>
			<form method="post">
				<input type="text" name="username" /> <small>try peter</small><br>
				<input type="submit">
			</form>
		`))
		return
	}

	// Now that the user is authorized, we set up a session. When validating / looking up tokens, we additionally get
	// the session. You can store anything you want in it.
	mySessionData := &session{
		UserID: req.Form.Get("username")
	}

	// It's also wise to check the requested scopes, e.g.:
	// if authorizeRequest.GetScopes().Has("admin") {
	//     http.Error(rw, "you're not allowed to do that", http.StatusForbidden)
	//     return
	// }

	// Now we need to get a response. This is the place where the AuthorizeEndpointHandlers kick in and start processing the request.
	// NewAuthorizeResponse is capable of running multiple response type handlers which in turn enables this library
	// to support open id connect.
	response, err := oauth2.NewAuthorizeResponse(ctx, req, ar, mySessionData)
	if err != nil {
		oauth2.WriteAuthorizeError(rw, ar, err)
		return
	}

	// Awesome, now we redirect back to the client redirect uri and pass along an authorize code
	oauth2.WriteAuthorizeResponse(rw, ar, response)
}

// The token endpoint is usually at "https://mydomain.com/oauth2/token"
func tokenHandlerFunc(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	ctx := NewContext()
	mySessionData := &session{}

	// This will create an access request object and iterate through the registered TokenEndpointHandlers to validate the request.
	accessRequest, err := oauth2.NewAccessRequest(ctx, req, mySessionData)
	if err != nil {
		oauth2.WriteAccessError(rw, accessRequest, err)
		return
	}
	
	if mySessionData.UserID == "super-admin-guy" {
		// do something...
	}

	// Next we create a response for the access request. Again, we iterate through the TokenEndpointHandlers
	// and aggregate the result in response.
	response, err := oauth2.NewAccessResponse(ctx, req, accessRequest)
	if err != nil {
		oauth2.WriteAccessError(rw, accessRequest, err)
		return
	}

	// All done, send the response.
	oauth2.WriteAccessResponse(rw, accessRequest, response)

	// The client has a valid access token now
}

func someResourceProviderHandlerFunc(rw http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	ctx := NewContext()
	mySessionData := &session{}
	requiredScope := "blogposts.create"

	ar, err := oauth2.ValidateToken(ctx, fosite.AccessTokenFromRequest(req), mySessionData, requiredScope)
	if err != nil {
		// ...
	}
	
	// if now error occurred the token + scope is valid and you have access to:
	// ar.GetClient().GetID(), ar.GetGrantedScopes(), ar.GetScopes(), mySessionData.UserID, ar.GetRequestedAt(), ...
}
```

### Code Examples

Fosite provides integration tests as well as a http server example:

* Fosite ships with an example app that runs in your browser: [Example app](fosite-example/main.go).
* If you want to check out how to enable specific handlers, check out the [integration tests](integration/).

If you have working examples yourself, please share them with us!

### Exemplary Storage Implementation

Fosite does not ship a storage implementation. This is intended, because requirements vary with every environment.
You can find a reference implementation at [fosite-example/internal/store.go](fosite-example/internal/store.go).
This storage fulfills requirements from all OAuth2 and OpenID Conenct handlers.

### Extensible handlers

OAuth2 is a framework. Fosite mimics this behaviour by enabling you to replace existing or create new OAuth2 handlers.
Of course, fosite ships handlers for all OAuth2 and OpenID Connect flows.

* **[Fosite OAuth2 Core Handlers](handler/oauth2)** implement the [Client Credentials Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4),
 [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3),
 [Implicit Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2),
 [Authorization Code Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1),
 [Refresh Token Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-6)
* **[Fosite OpenID Connect Handlers](handler/openid)** implement the
 [Authentication using the Authorization Code Flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth),
 [Authentication using the Implicit Flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth),
 [Authentication using the Hybrid Flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth)
