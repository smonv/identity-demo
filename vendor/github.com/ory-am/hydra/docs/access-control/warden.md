## Warden

The Warden is usually called from your own services ("resource providers"), not from third parties. Hydra prevents
third parties from having access to these endpoints per default, but you can change that with custom policies.

The Warden endpoints are documented [here](http://docs.hdyra.apiary.io/#reference/warden:-access-control-for-resource-providers).
