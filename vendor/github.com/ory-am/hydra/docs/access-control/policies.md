# Access Control Policies

Hydra uses the Access Control Library [Ladon](https://github.com/ory-am/ladon).
For a deep dive, it is a good idea to read the [Ladon Docs](https://github.com/ory-am/ladon#ladon).

In Hydra, policy based access control is when you decide if:

- Aaron (subject) is allowed (effect) to create (action) a new forum post (resource) when accessing the forum website from IP 192.168.178.3 (context).
- Richard (subject) is allowed (effect) to delete (action) a status update (resource) when he is the author (context).

Or, more *generalized:* **Who** is **able** to do **what** on **something** with some **context**.

* **Who (Subject)**: An arbitrary unique subject name, for example "ken" or "printer-service.mydomain.com".
* **Able (Effect)**: The effect which is always "allow" or "deny".
* **What (Action)**: An arbitrary action name, for example "delete", "create" or "scoped:action:something".
* **Something (Resource)**: An arbitrary unique resource name, for example "something", "resources:articles:1234" or some uniform resource name like "urn:isbn:3827370191".
* **Context (Context)**: The current context which may environment information like the IP Address, request date, the resource owner name, the department ken is working in and anything you like.

Policies are JSON documents managed via the [Policy API](http://docs.hdyra.apiary.io/#reference/policies).

```
{
  // A required unique identifier. Used primarily for database retrieval.
  "id": "68819e5a-738b-41ec-b03c-b58a1b19d043",
  
  // A optional human readable description.
  "description": "something humanly readable",
  
  // A subject can be an user or a service. It is the "who" in "who is allowed to do what on something".
  // As you can see here, you can use regular expressions inside < >.
  "subjects": ["user", "<peter|max>"],
    
  
  // Should access be allowed or denied?
  // Note: If multiple policies match an access request, ladon.DenyAccess will always override ladon.AllowAccess
  // and thus deny access.
  "effect": "allow",
  
  // Which resources this policy affects.
  // Again, you can put regular expressions in inside < >.
  "resources": ["articles:<[0-9]+>"],
  
  // Which actions this policy affects. Supports RegExp
  // Again, you can put regular expressions in inside < >.
  "actions": ["create","update"],
  
  // Under which conditions this policy is "active".
  "conditions": {
    "owner": {
     // In this example, the policy is only "active" when the requested subject is the owner of the resource as well.
      "type": "EqualsSubjectCondition",
      "options": {}
    }
   }
}
```

## Examples

### Let everyone read public JWKs

```
[
  {
    "description": "Allow everyone including anonymous users to read JSON Web Keys having Key ID *public*.",
    "subject": ["<.*>"],
    "effect": "allow",
    "resources": [
      "rn:hydra:keys:<[^:]+>:public"
    ],
    "permissions": [
      "get"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Deny anyone from reading private JWKs

```
[
  {
    "description": "Explicitly deny everyone reading JSON Web Keys with Key ID *private*.",
    "subject": ["<.*>"],
    "effect": "allow",
    "resources": [
      "rn:hydra:keys:<[^:]+>:private"
    ],
    "permissions": [
      "get"
    ]
  }
]
```
